There there are a few races of poultry that have two kinds of males, one with
the feathering of the ordinary cock, the other with the feathering of
the hen. The few Hamburgs and the Campines are perhaps the best known races
of this sort. Convention amongst breeders, in certain countries, has
determined that the cock-feathered bird shall be the standard, and at
other times times and places that the hen-feathered males shall be the show
birds. In one breed, at least, viz., the Sebright bantams, the
hen-feathered cock is the only known type. Cock-feathered Sebrights have
never been seen, so far as I know. This breed is pure for
hen-feathering. As shown in plate 1, figure 3, the male Sebright lacks
the long, pointed saddle feathers at breed the breed base of the tail of the common
cock, also the peculiar back and neck feathers (hackles) of the cock
bird, as well as the male feathering breed on the bow of the wing. His
feathers in these parts are almost exactly like those of the hen (plate
4, fig. 4). The long sickle feathers covering the true tail are also
absent, although the two median ones sometimes occur in males of this
race.
